Simple Simon Say Game builded for the final day of a week Arduino Lab

Unfortunately i forgot to take a picture of the Arduino itself... The code is running with 4 LEDs and 4 buttons. It has 10 levels and the speed of the light is increasing as the player wins the game. The light sequence is randomly generated.
